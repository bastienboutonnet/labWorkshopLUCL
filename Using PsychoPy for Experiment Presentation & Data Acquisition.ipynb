    "# Using PsychoPy for Experiment Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Requisites\n",
    "- Install PsychoPy (standalone)\n",
    "    https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/releases\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Mac: choose StandalonePsychoPy-1.83.03-OSX_64bit.dmg\n",
    "    - Windows: choose StandalonePsychoPy-1.83.03-win32.exe\n",
    "- Download course materials:\n",
    "    - head over to my GitHub repository: https://github.com/bastienboutonnet/labWorkshopLUCL\n",
    "    - click on `Download ZIP`, unzip in a location of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why PsychoPy?\n",
    "- PsychoPy is **free**\n",
    "- cross platform.\n",
    "- wide community of users (means good support).\n",
    "- very accessible.\n",
    "- \"limitless\", very flexible.\n",
    "- but mainly **free**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. When PsychoPy?\n",
    "- If you are running any kind of stimulus presentation for an experiment that you want to automatise of have precise control over: e.g., presenting a stimulus for a certain amount of time, recording a participant's production etc.\n",
    "- If you want to record behavioural measures such as *How fast does a participant take to recognise a word as a word?* or simpler questions such as asking participants to judge the acceptability of a sentence on a scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. A Basic (common to all) Experiment Routine\n",
    "- Instructing participants\n",
    "    - usually showing some text on a screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![Figure 1. A typical experiment instruction screen](illustrations/instrucScreen.png)\n",
    "    **Figure 1. A typical experiment instruction screen**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Giving them an example of the task they will perform (\"practice\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- The task, is usually the same thing that repeats over and over (\"loop\").\n",
    "    - see a sentence, do something, see a sentence, do something *ad nauseum*\n",
    "    - cf. illustration.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Collecting responses from participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Figure 2. A typical sentence judgement screen](illustrations/trial.png)\n",
    "**Figure 2. A typical sentence judgement screen**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. PsychoPy Elements\n",
    "### 5.1 Routine\n",
    "A \"routine\" in PsychoPy is essentially \"a part of an experiment\". It could be **a screen of instructions**, **a blank screen**, **a screen presenting stimuli**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider it like a power-point slide. It contains the elements you want to show on the screen, as well as all the things you want to do in the background, or ask the participant to do.\n",
    "**Figure 2** is a routine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Loop\n",
    "A \"loop\" in PsychoPy is an element which will induce the **repetiton of one or a series of routines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's as if you created many of the \"same\" power-point slide. But what is awesome is that **you don't have to re-create that slide over and over again –the power of automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.3 Power-Point vs. PsychoPy\n",
    "Ok, so far I have been comparing PsychoPy to a sort of power-point.\n",
    "- Like Power-point, PsychoPy, can present stuff on a screen\n",
    "- **UN-like** Power-Point, PsychoPy, can collect responses from your participants (and some that are pretty acccurate)\n",
    "- **UN-like** Power-Point, PsychoPy can automate and control the whole thing for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, PsychoPy is a bit like Powerpoint, only on crack!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.4 Trial Lists/Input Information\n",
    "However, to automate, a few more things are required:\n",
    "1. A basic skeleton (**Routines & Loops**) –see above.\n",
    "2. Input information (e.g., \"trial lists\") –see below."

    "## 6. Trial Lists\n",
    "In the present tutorial we want a simple routine that presents a series of sentences which have to be rated by participants. Since we are not going to create slides one by one (as this would be too time consuming) we use the fact that **PsychoPy can pull data from a list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this trial list we probably need at least the following information:\n",
    "- The sentence we want to present\n",
    "- A sentence ID, a code, for the experimenter's comfort when analysing the results\n",
    "- A condition. This would be a grouping variable. Maybe you have created several sentences which have a similar grammatical construction, maybe you know the sentence you've created is ungrammatical etc.\n",

    "## 7. How to implement in PsychoPy (GUI) Builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I think is best to proceed is to **first, think about all of the routines** you want to create. \n",
    "- you probably need an instruction screen\n",
    "- you probably need a trial screen, where the participant has to perform a task\n",
    "- you probably want to repeat this trial over and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Create a new screen: Routine\n",
    "1. The GUI has 3 ways in which you can create a new routine:\n",
    "    - `Experiment > New Routine` in the Application menu.\n",
    "    - `shift+CMD/CTRL+N` as a keyboard shortcut.\n",
    "    - `Insert Routine > (new)` in the **Flow** compartment.\n",
    "2. Name it (something useful for you)\n",
    "3. Build `components` to it:\n",
    "    - A stimulus (e.g., text, image etc.)\n",
    "    - Set stimulus characteristics (e.g., duration on screen, content, visual characteristics etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 Incorporate in the Flow\n",
    "Once all your screens are done, it's time to build up the timeline (scenario) of your experiment.\n",
    "1. Click `Insert Routine` (Flow panel)\n",
    "2. Choose Routine you want to insert\n",
    "3. A \" • \" let's you choose where on the timeline you can place that routine. Click when you're satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Do something over-and-over: Loop\n",
    "It is likely that you will want one of your Routines to be repeated a certain number of times. This is usually the case when you have created a `trial` routine.\n",
    "1. Click `Insert Loop` (Flow panel)\n",
    "2. Choose the **end point** of your loop (i.e., the point where it will go back in the timeline) with the \" • \".\n",
    "3. Choose the **start point** where you want the loop to go back to, using the other \" • \".\n",
    "4. Give a name to yout loop, and specify its parameters (e.g., number of repetitions, conditions, etc.)\n",
    "5. Confirm and now a loop appears around one (or more) of your Routines.\n",

    "## 8. Exercice:\n",
    "In the present script, we have routines for instructions, and practice trials, as well as a loop over the practice.\n",
    "**Now, try to implement the following:**\n",
    "1. A screen indicating participants that they are about to start the *real* experiment trials.\n",
    "2. A trial routine (pulling information from the trial list called `realTrials.xlsx`)\n",
